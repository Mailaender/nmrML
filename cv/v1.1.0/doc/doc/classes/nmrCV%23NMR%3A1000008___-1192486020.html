<li class="asserted"><a href="../annotationproperties/comment___1501100887.html" class='Annotation Property' title="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment">rdfs:comment</a> <span class='literal'>"see also http://www.chemeddl.org/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/915d785a-54ec-4259-a8c6-eeb5d4b0c55a/IntroNMR.pdf?guest=true<br /><br />One of the problems that should be apparent after observing the spectrum and the FID is that it is not possible <br />to determine if the frequency is positive or negative.  Under normal conditions this would not be a problem.  <br />After all, what is a negative frequency?  The problem arises in NMR because the signals are at very high <br />frequencies.  In a typical magnet with a 7 Tesla field, protons are observed at approximately 300 MHz.  At such <br />a high frequency it is very difficult and expensive to detect, transmit, amplify and sample the signal.  These <br />acquisition problems are simplified by looking at frequency differences.  The instrument uses a spectrometer <br />frequency and all signal frequencies are measured relative to the spectrometer frequency.  If a molecule <br />produces two signals, one at 300,000,001 Hz and another at 299,999,999 Hz, and the spectrometer frequency <br />is 300,000,000 Hz, the first signal is at +1 Hz and the second is at -1 Hz.  Electronically the lower frequency <br />signals are very easy frequency to detect, transmit, amplify and sample.<br />The complication with this rotating frame of reference is that a single detector can not distinguish positive and <br />negative frequencies.  Double check this by changing the sign of the signal above and observing the spectrum.  <br />Where is the signal observed in the spectrum? <br />This problem is why quadrature detection is important.  Quadrature detection uses two detector channels <br />separated by 90 degrees.  These are referred to as the real channel and the imaginary channel.  Using these <br />two channels, it is possible to distinguish positive and negative frequencies.  This section shows how the <br />quadrature signal is processed to obtain an NMR spectrum.<br />The Fourier transform produces a complex number with a real and an imaginary component.  The Re function <br />extracts the real spectrum and the Im function extracts the imaginary spectrum from the complex number."</span></li>
