This spectrum is from a metabolomic profiling experiment <i>Humulus
lupulus L.</i> The spectrum was recorded on a Varian VNMRS 600 NMR
spectrometer operating at a proton NMR frequency of 599.83 MHz using a 5
mm inverse detection cryoprobe. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with the
following parameters: digital resolution 0.367 Hz/point (32 K complex
data points); pulse width (pw) = 3 ls (4&deg;C); relaxation delay = 23.7
s; acquisition time = 2.7 s; number of transients = 160.
