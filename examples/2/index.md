High-throughput phenotyping tomato fruit for integration with Omics data. Characterization of tomato fruits to 2 stages of development (expansion and red orange fruit) from 12 contrasting genotypes (8  lines and 4 F1 hybrids).

Metabolome analyses were performed at the Metabolome Facility of Bordeaux, using quantitative proton NMR ( 1H-NMR) profiling of  polar extracts. Polar metabolites were extracted on lyophilized powder (50 mg DW per biological replicate) with an ethanol–water series at 80 °C. The lyophilized extracts were titrated to pH 6 and lyophilized again. Each dried titrated extract was solubilized in 0.5 ml of D O with tri-methylsilyl-propionic-2,2,3,3-d  acid (TSP) sodium salt (0.01% final concentration) for chemical shift calibration and EDTA (5 mM final concentration for the CE and 2 mM for the OR stage). H-NMR spectra were recorded at 500.162 MHz on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) using an ATMA inverse weight basis to be comparable. All the analyses were performed 5 mm probe flushed with nitrogen gas and an electronic reference for quantification (ERETIC2). Sixty-four scans of  32 000 data points each were acquired with a 90 ° pulse angle, a 6000 Hz spectral width, a 2.73 s acquisition time, and a 25 s recycle delay. Two technological replicates were used per biological replicate. Preliminary data processing was conducted with TOPSPIN 3.0 software (Bruker Biospin, Wissembourg, France). The assignments of  metabolites in the H-NMR spectra were made by comparing the proton chemical shifts with values of  the <a href="http://bit.ly/meryb" target="_blank">MeRy-B metabolomic database</a>,by comparison with spectra of  authentic compounds recorded under the same solvent conditions, and/or by spiking the samples. The metabolite concentrations were calculated using AMIX (version 3.9.7, Bruker) software. The 144 H-NMR spectra of  the data set were converted into JCAMP-DX format and deposited with associated metadata into the Metabolomics Repository of  Bordeaux MeRy-B (<a href=" http://www.cbib.u-bordeaux2.fr/MERYB/res/project/T10001" target="_blank">T10001</a>).
