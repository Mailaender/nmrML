This spectrum is a a reference spectrum for 1-Methylhistidine (HMDB metabolite HMDB00001). The atom assignments have been done using nmrML-Assign, which is an interactive tool for creating reference spectra and generating nmrML-formatted files. nmrML-Assign first processes the uploaded fid with Bayesil. The user also provides a structure for the compound of interest. Atom assignments to spectral clusters/peaks of interest can be made using this structure.
