Study Title	"Urine Latin Square Spike-In for Testing MetaboQuant"
Study Submission Date	"2013-01-03"
Study Public Release Date	"2013-01-10"
Study Description	"To test the quantification performance of MetaboQuant and other NMR quantification tools, a set of eight metabolites were added to replicates of a urine sample in varying concentrations. The metabolites were alanine, creatinine, histidine, betaine, acetate, phosphocreatine, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and lactate. These were added in concentrations of 6000, 3000, 1500, 750, 375, 188, 94, and 47 micromol/L in a Latin Square design. 2D 1H-13C-HSQC spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer employing a triple-resonance cryoprobe and z-gradients."

Study Protocol Description	"A spot urine specimen was collected from an apparently healthy volunteer and split into eight aliquots. A Latin Square spike-in experiment was prepared, where the sum of molar amounts of spike-in’s added to aliquots of a biological specimen is the same. Eight different metabolites, namely alanine, creatinine, histidine, betaine, acetate, phosphocreatine, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and lactate (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), were added in varying amounts to the eight urine aliquots."	""	"400 μL of this spiked urine were added to 200 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 50 μL of deuterium oxide containing TSP as reference substance."	"2D 1H-13C HSQC spectra were acquired on an AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) using a 5 mm Triple-resonance cryoprobe with z-gradients probe at a proton frequency of 600 MHz and ambient temperature of 298 Kelvin"	"2048x128 data points were collected using the pulse program r_hsqcetgppr (Bruker BioSpin) using eight scans per increment, a relaxation delay of three seconds, an acquisition time of 0.14 seconds and 16 dummy scans. This resulted in a total acquisition time of 56 minutes per spectrum. The spectral widths were set to 12 and 165 ppm in the proton and carbon dimensions, respectively. Water suppression was achieved using presaturation during the relaxation delay."	""	"For metabolite assignment, a urinary 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectrum was used. Amix 3.9.13 (Bruker BioSpin) was used for peak picking. An NMR peak search was performed using the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (available at http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/), the Human Metabolome Database (available at http://www.hmdb.ca/) and the BBIOREFCODE database (Bruker BioSpin). To assign the signals, the spectrum was manually overlaid with reference spectra of pure compounds."	"MetaboQuant is a tool developed by Matthias S. Klein that allows reliable quantification from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum peak integrals by using individual calibration factors for each peak. Additionally, several outlier detection methods have been implemented to exclude overlapped and corrupted peaks from quantification. Detailed information about MetaboQuant can be found in the manual that is included in the file MetaboQuant.zip http://genomics.uni-regensburg.de/software/NMR/MetaboQuant_1.2.zip http://genomics.uni-regensburg.de/site/institute/software/metaboquant MetaboQuant is a tool developed by Matthias S.

On other operating systems such as Linux or Mac OS, you may run MetaboQuant from within Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). For this you need: Matlab version 7.1.0.246 (R14) Service Pack 3 or newer. To install MetaboQuant, download the following files: MCRInstallerR2007b.exe and MetaboQuant.zip. Run the file MCRInstallerR2007b.exe to install the required Matlab run-time routines. Extract the file MetaboQuant.zip to a new folder. To run MetaboQuant, double-click on the file MetaboQuant.exe. Starting MetaboQuant may take some minutes, as the Matlab run-time environment takes some time to be loaded. Extract MetaboQuant.zip to a new folder. Start Matlab and change the working directory to the MetaboQuant installation folder, e.g. using the command cd. To run MetaboQuant, type MetaboQuant in the Matlab command line."
