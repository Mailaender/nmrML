# Tools supporting nmrML

The nmrML development team has also fostered and coordinated the creation of nmrML aware webservices and tools covering a large fraction of a typical NMR data acquisition and processing workflow, i.e. to generate, convert, process, validate and publish nmrML files. Additionally, we have worked closely with open source and commercial tool developers to encourage nmrML format adoption. Available nmrML compliant tools are here listed as follows:
(Tool Category, Tool name, Key Functions, URL, Developer)


# Format Converters

### nmrML converter (Java)
Converts vendor to nmrML format:
